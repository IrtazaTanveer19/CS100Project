# CS100Project
GitHub repository containing my final coding project for CS100 (Computational Problem Solving)

All of the code is located within the folder labelled "Wolfram Alpha 2.0". In order to run the code natively, simply download the folder and open it on your editor and compile the .cpp file labelled "Project code.cpp".
For convenience, this folder also contains a .exe file of the program (just have your antivirus authorise its download).
